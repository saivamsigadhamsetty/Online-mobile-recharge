# Online-mobile-recharge
The case study ‘Online Mobile Recharge’ gives us the information about all the mobile service
providers. This application provides us the complete information regarding any mobile service
provider in terms of their plans, options, benefits, etc. Suppose, any Airtel customer wants to
have the information of all the schemes and services provided by the company, he/she can have
the information and according to his convenience he can recharge the mobile from the same
application. The major advantage of this proposed system is to have the recharging facility of
any service provider under same roof.<br/><br/>
***Service Provider*** is the one who is nothing but the mobile service provider like all the
companies who are giving the mobile connections come under this module. Functionality of this
module is to make the mobile recharging of their company basing on the availability of balance
in the admin account. Request comes from the user and it is going to be verified at the admin for
the availability of balance and then the request is forwarded to the service provided to make the
mobile recharge.<br/><br/>
***Administrator*** is the one who monitors all users and user transactions. Admin also monitors all
the Service Providers, all the user accounts, and amounts paid by the user and amounts paid to
Service providers. When the request given by the user admin checks the available balance in the
user account then request is forwarded to the Service Provider from there user request gets
processed. Admin haves the complete information related to user and all the information related
to the schemes and other information of different recharge coupons provided by the Service
Providers. All the data is maintained at the Admin level. Admin is having the rights to restrict
any user.<br/><br/>
